            <h1>Advent of Code 2024: Update 1</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">2024-12-08</p>
            <p>
                A quick update on my progress on Advent of code!
            </p>
            <h2 class="in-blog">Day 1 - 3</h2>
            <p>
                These first couple of days were not that interesting as I just stayed in my comfort zone.
                On day one I used <i>Rust</i> and on day two and three I used <i>Python</i>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="in-blog">Day 4</h2>
            <p>
                A language I had been wanting to try out was <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. 
                Haskell is a compiled, purely functional language. 
                I really like the functional approach to programming and the way you have to think about it. <br>
                After following their <a href="https://www.haskell.org/get-started/">get started</a> page and setting everything up I started my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you had a look at my <a href="https://github.com/DynamicGoose/advent-of-code-2024">repo</a>, you would ask yourself: "Why did he say he used Haskell when all the code in the day_04 folder is written in Lua?" <br>
                Well... <br>
                I severely underestimated the amount of time it would take me to learn Haskell and in the end, I gave up and used <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> instead.
                Lua is a small scripting language that is ment to be easy to embed into a project. Writig day 4 in Lua made things quite a bit easier.
                The only thing that took a bit of time to wrap my head around were lua <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html">tables</a>. (And also that they start at index 1)
            </p>
            <h2 class="in-blog">Day 5</h2>
            <p>
                On day 5 I used <i>C</i>. Everyone has to learn a bit of C at some point. And though I used it in the past, my C skills had become pretty rusty.
                It took me a bit to solve the first puzzle, but I could reuse most of the conde from puzzle 1 in puzzle 2.
            </p>
            <h2 class="in-blog">Day 6</h2>
            <p>
                On day 6 I decided to use <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>. Scala runs on the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Java_virtual_machine">JVM</a>.
                That means it also has interoperability with Java. Scala is a bit more on the functional side though. <br>
                I did not have a lot of time on the 6th so I had to do most of the work for day 6 on the 7th.
            </p>
            <h2 class="in-blog">Next...</h2>
            <p>
                I have decided to revisit <i>Haskell</i>. It will probably take some time to learn the basics and I will probably have to catch up on the puzzles. <br>
                My reason for doing this is because I find Haskell (and the concept of functional programming in general) very interesting.
                After starting to learn Haskell I am also beginning to change the way I look at programming problems, which feels very refreshing and exciting. <br>
                If you want to look into Haskell yourself, I have found the following resources very useful/enlightening: <br> 
                <br>
                - <a href="https://haskyll.github.io/">Haskell bit by bit</a> -> exactly what it says <br>
                - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voRBS0r4EyI">In search of Code Purity</a> -> A rust focused look at functional programming. (Make sure to watch the chapter about pure functions) <br>
                - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSmkqocn0oQ">Haskell is Useless</a> -> A (in my opinion) very good take on functional programming by Simon Peyton Jones

                Until next post. <br>
