    Last year I started developig my own game-engine in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. 
    At this point I had already done some game-dev in <i>Unity</i> and had thought about switching to <a href="https://godotengine.org/">GODOT</a>. 
    But because of the type of game I wanted to develop (a <i>SPACE</i> game) I had to constantly fight Unity's default physics implementation.<br>
    This is how the idea of developing my own engine was born.<br>

    <i>"This guy is just another one of those average Rust fans, who won't shut up about it."</i><br>
    But you are wrong! What you can see here is a prime example for an <i>average rust enjoyer!</i><br>
