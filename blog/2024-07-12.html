    Last year I started developing my own game-engine in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. 
    At this point I had already done some game-dev in <i>Unity</i> and had thought about switching to <a href="https://godotengine.org/">GODOT</a>. 
    But because of the type of game I wanted to develop (a <i>SPACE</i> game) I had to constantly fight Unity's default physics implementation.<br>
    This is how the idea of developing my own engine was born.<br>

<h2 class="in-blog">Rust...</h2>
<p>
    If I said <i>Rust</i> was the best language for everything, I would be lying.
    But personally I use at a lot, mainly because of the compiler (It even warns you about the greek question mark).
    Because (nearly) everything has to be specified by you, it forces you to really think about the code you are writing.
    In my experience this has led me to catch a lot of bugs even before compiling, which removes a lot of the pain you get using languages like <i>Javascript</i> or <i>Python</i>. <br>
    But this <b>isn't</b> always <b>important</b>! Sometimes it is worth it trading this safety for speed and simplicity. <br>
    Anyways... I'm using <i>Rust</i> and I haven't regretted that decision until now. So let's dive into the actual topic!
</p>
<h2 class="in-blog">The <i>Perfect</i> Game-Engine</h2>
<p>
    It all started with not one, but a couple of ideas. I had been using Unity for game development for some time, but my experience had not been great.
    After desperately trying to bend the default physics implementation to my needs I realized it.
    It wasn't that the engine was bad, it just wasn't made for the sorta thing I was trying to do. <br>
    So an idea started to brew in my head. <br>
    I was gonna make my own engine, perfectly suited for my use case. In my enthusiasm I made a plan and wrote down some requirements. <br>
    This was gonna be my <i>Magnum Opus</i>! <br>
    <br>
</p>
<h3>Requirements: </h3>
<p>
    - High-detail voxel rendering <br>
    - Advanced physics simulation <br>
    - Networking <br>
    - VR-support <br>
    - Using other languages than Rust with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> <br>
    - Also has to run on <i>potatoes</i>
</p>
<p>
    I was also fascinated by the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Entity_component_system">ECS</a> architecture, especially after seeing what <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> did with it.
    So like Bevy, I was gonna have an ECS as the basis of my engine. <br>

<h2 class="in-blog">First Part of The Journey (Pleasant)</h2>
<p>
    After learning about ECS, I had to <i>learn</i> how to implement it. <br>
